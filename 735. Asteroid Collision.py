class Solution:
# Pattern: "Stack for collision/interaction problems"
# - Use a stack to maintain elements that are still valid/alive.
# - For each new element, compare with the stack top:
#     * While there is conflict â†’ resolve it (pop from stack or discard current).
#     * If element survives all conflicts â†’ push it to stack.
# - In Python, `while ... else` is a neat trick:
#     else runs only if no `break` occurs â†’ meaning the new element survived.
# This pattern is common in problems like asteroid collision, 
# next greater element, parentheses validation, etc.
